# coffee-snippets README

This is a collection of snippets imported straight from the TextMate repo (here)[https://github.com/jashkenas/coffee-script-tmbundle.git]

## Features

If you have used Atom or TextMate you should be familiar with the snippets here. The standard 'fora', fore', 'if', 'elif', etc...

I suggest you just start coding and appreciate the standard snippets from every other major text editor ðŸ˜‰

## Known Issues

* There is a snippet that is supposed to automatically wrap a selection in `#{}` when you press `#` inside of an interpreted string i.e. `"Hello #{user.firstName}"`. It doesn't work and I have yet to figure out why. Any input in this regard would be appreciated.
